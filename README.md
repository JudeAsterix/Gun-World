# Gun World!
A game about shooting your enemies into oblivion!
# Wait, what?
On June 18th, 2018, the first version of Gun World came into the world as a block that can move and jump around poorly. And that was it. Now, it's still not much in terms of graphics, but in the end, I hope to create a small but fun game about a Smash Brothers style fighting game, but with guns.
# So, where's the game?
In the dist folder, there will be a jar file of the latest version of the game. You'll be able to play it there.
# Can I help?
Well, this is more a passion project than anything, but if you have any suggestions, don't be afraid of putting some in the comments.
Also, the bugs will probably be everywhere, so be sure to comment about that as well.
